Course Syllabus
Autumn 2017

Course: Computer Programming II	Year: 2017   Quarter: Autumn

Course Catalog Description: Transition from basic programming skills to a rigorous process of software development. Familiarization with higher level programming techniques (recursion, generic programming, stacks, queues, trees, searching, and sorting). Emphasizes connection between algorithmic thought and implementation.  Must be concurrently enrolled in CSSKL 162.
CSS Requirements & Prerequisites: Prerequisite: minimum grade of 2.7 in CSS 161, CSS 142, or CSE 142; co-requisite: CSSSKL 143.
Required Textbook:   Walter Savitch, Absolute Java, newest edition, Addison-Wesley, 2007-2014. Any additional required readings and topics will also be posted on the online on the website above. 

Course goals:
Students develop competencies associated with problem‚Äêsolving, design, testing, programming, and management techniques. Besides learning programming fundamentals, you will see common applications and consider these applications in society. Good software engineering and algorithm analysis techniques are used throughout. As with most technical courses, besides ability and motivation, it takes time to learn and master the subject.
