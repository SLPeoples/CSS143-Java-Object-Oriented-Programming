SearchAlgorithm and BinSearchDriver have been modified and commented for minor testing. 
Program functions correctly with original (unedited) SearchAlgorithm and BinSearchDriver.
FindFile class implements a check method rather than IllegalArgumentsException because the 
class never threw the exception and the method accomplishes the same task.
